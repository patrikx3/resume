    = <<<EOF
Right now, I primarily focus on artifical intelligence frameworks, microservices, web and Electron desktop applications (and Ionic for phones/tablets as well).
<br/><br/>
I have been practicing imaging applications and coding since I was small. I really like beautiful animation and structured programming.  
<br/><br/>
Since about 2000, I have been using object-oriented and functional programming. By about 2001, I have been building diagrams and models. I like architect, Microsoft and alike tools.
<br/><br/>
Usually, I engineer web based systems but I deal with other applications as well.  I like server, client, desktop, mobile, database and component methods.  I architect simple solutions that are independent of operating system, language and framework.   
<br/><br/>
What I like and do: analysis, architecture, test, build, continuous integration, code style, code review, documentation, deployment, code coverage, tasks, developer support, development operations (DevOps), distributed - co-operative systems and development.
